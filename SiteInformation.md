2. **Irrigated maize-soybean rotation**  
   Coordinates: 41°09′53.5′′N, 96°28′12.3′′W  
   Elevation: 362 m  
   - **Description**: This site is equipped with center pivot irrigation and has been in a maize–soybean rotation since 2001. Prior to the study, it had a 10-year history of no-till maize–soybean rotation. The soil consists of 50% Tomek, 27% Filbert/Filmore, and 23% Yutan series. Volumetric soil moisture at field capacity is 0.41 m³ m⁻³.  
   - **Crop Management**: Nitrogen (N) was applied as urea ammonium nitrate solution, with 180 kg N/ha applied in three applications (2/3 pre-plant and 1/3 through fertigation).

3. **Rainfed maize-soybean rotation**  
   Coordinates: 41°10′46.8′′N, 96°26′22.7′′W  
   Elevation: 362 m  
   - **Description**: This site relies on rainfall and has been in a maize–soybean rotation since 2001. Prior to the study, it had a variable cropping history of wheat, soybean, oats, and maize grown in small plots with tillage. The soil consists of 70% Tomek, 20% Filbert/Filmore, and 10% Yutan series. Volumetric soil moisture at field capacity is 0.39 m³ m⁻³.  
   - **Crop Management**: Nitrogen (N) was applied as a single pre-plant application of 120 kg N/ha.
